# k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm
In four years of my career into analytics I have built more than 80% of classification models and just 15-20% regression models. These ratios can be more or less generalized throughout the industry. The reason of a bias towards classification models is that most analytical problem involves making a decision. For instance will a customer attrite or not, should we target customer X for digital campaigns, whether customer has a high potential or not etc. These analysis are more insightful and directly links to an implementation roadmap. In this article, we will talk about another widely used classification technique called K-nearest neighbors (KNN) . Our focus will be primarily on how does the algorithm work and how does the input parameter effect the output/prediction.
